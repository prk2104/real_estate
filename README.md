Real estate projects / Machine Learning / Kaggle Competition

This real estate project was a project on Kaggle the purpose of which was to classify apartment listings in New York City, some areas of Boston and some areas of California  into low, medium, and high interest by customers of this service.  

The project does some exploratory data analysis, some feature engineering, and then applies multiple machine learning methods (XG Boost, Random Forest) to classify the listings.

There are relevant comments in the Jupyter Notebook files that explain what is happening step by step.
